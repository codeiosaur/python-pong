# python-pong

### Summary
These are test programs that I used to learn pygame in tkinter. They are both pong clones and are essentially the same except for the fact that the pygame version has game over text.

### Dependencies
tkinterpong uses tkinter, time and random, which are all avaialable through the standard library.
pygame pong uses pygame, sys, time and random instead, which are all avaialable through the standard library except for pygame.
pygame can be download by running
`
python -m pip install pygame
`
or
` 
conda install pygame
`
